DeepInfant uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to determine which acoustic features are associated with each of a baby's needs.

For example, babies who are in pain demonstrate cries with high energy, while a fussy cry may have more periods of silence. We are preparing our findings for academic review and publication within a single well-trained model based on academic datasets.

## Abstract
DeepInfant is an advanced neural network system specifically engineered for infant cry classification and analysis. The system employs deep learning techniques to help caregivers accurately interpret their baby's needs in real-time. The latest version, **DeepInfant V2**, achieves 89% accuracy through significant architectural improvements including:

- Enhanced feature extraction using mel-spectrograms and STFT
- Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for better temporal modeling
- Expanded classification capabilities covering 5 distinct cry types
- Optimized model efficiency with 3x faster inference time
- Robust training on augmented datasets with over 10,000 labeled cry samples

Our research demonstrates that combining specialized audio processing with deep learning can provide reliable, real-time baby cry analysis through mobile applications, helping both parents and healthcare providers better respond to infant needs.

## Summary
DeepInfant is a machine learning model that uses artificial intelligence to predict your baby's needs based on sound classification of cries.

## Dataset
DeepInfant was initially developed as part of a final project in the Speech Technology Course at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden). The latest version, **DeepInfant V2**, has been trained using a combination of private datasets along with published datasets to improve its generalization and accuracy. The training was further enhanced based on the V1 methodologies with additional refinements to optimize performance.

### Data Collection & Labeling (from babycry)
Based on approaches from the babycry repository, data collection involved:

1. **Collection of short audio segments** (~2-7 seconds).
2. **Labeling** of audio clips using crowd-sourced and in-house volunteer annotations.  
3. **Tagging** each audio segment with:
   - Presence or absence of cry,
   - Potential need (e.g., hunger, discomfort, pain),
   - Age and gender.

### Data Augmentation (from babycry)
To increase the robustness and variability of the training data, **DeepInfant V2** leverages augmentation techniques:

- **Pitch Shifting**: Modifying the pitch of the audio sample slightly to simulate different baby vocal ranges.
- **Time Stretching**: Speeding up or slowing down the cry without affecting pitch to capture different crying tempos.
- **Adding Noise**: Introducing background or white noise to simulate real-world environments (e.g., household hum, slight chatter).

These augmentations help the model generalize better and handle varying acoustic conditions.

## DeepInfant V2: Expanded Methodology
By integrating lessons from the babycry repository, **DeepInfant V2** expands upon the initial pipeline:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Trimming or zero-padding audio files to uniform lengths (2–7 seconds).
   - Applying **data augmentation** (pitch shifting, time stretching, noise addition).

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**
   - **Mel-Spectrogram**  
   - **Log-Mel-Spectrogram normalization**  

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spectral feature extraction.  
   - Recurrent layers (LSTM) for temporal context modeling.
   - Fully connected layers for final classification.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Use of cross-validation and hold-out validation sets.
   - Metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**.

| unknown | Unclassified crying pattern | 0.975s | Variable patterns not matching other categories |

## Training Algorithm
DeepInfant V2 is trained using a deep neural network with multiple stages of processing:

```math
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Input: Audio waveform } x(t) \text{ sampled at } 16,000 \text{ Hz} \\
& \text{1. Apply Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT): } X(f, t) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2\pi fn/N} \\
& \text{2. Convert to Mel Spectrogram: } S = \text{MelFilterBank}(X) \\
& \text{3. Normalize and apply log transformation: } S' = \log(S + \epsilon) \\
& \text{4. Pass through convolutional layers with batch normalization} \\
& \text{5. Extract high-level features using a recurrent neural network (LSTM)} \\
& \text{6. Fully connected layers for classification with Softmax activation} \\
& \text{Output: Probability distribution over cry classes}.
\end{aligned}
```

## Building a model

The audio clips have a sample rate of 16000 Hz and a duration of about ~7 secs. This means there are about 16000*7 numbers per second representing the audio data. We take a fast fourier transform (FFT) of a 2048 sample window, slide it by 512 samples, and repeat the process on the 7-sec clip. The resulting representation can be shown as a 2D image and is called a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). Since humans perceive sound on a logarithmic scale, we'll convert the STFT to the [mel scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale). The [librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/) library lets us load an audio file and convert it to a melspectrogram:

 ```python
import librosa
import librosa.display

fname = 'test-1-audio001.wav'
samples, sample_rate = librosa.load(fname)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=[4,4])
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)
ax.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)
ax.set_frame_on(False)
S = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=samples, sr=sample_rate)
librosa.display.specshow(librosa.power_to_db(S, ref=np.max))
```

The `melspectrogram` of a baby crying looks like the image below:

### Augmentations in Practice
From the babycry approach, we often apply augmentations **before** or **after** extracting the Mel-Spectrogram. For instance, pitch shifting is done on the raw waveform, whereas time stretching can be applied at the waveform level or sometimes in the frequency domain.

In order to build the spectrograms of the audio samples needed for training the model, we'll be using the fantastic [audio loader module for fastai v1 built by Jason Hartquist](https://github.com/sevenfx/fastai_audio).

```python
n_fft = 2048 # output of fft will have shape [1024 x n_frames]
n_hop = 512  # 50% overlap between frames
n_mels = 128 # compress 2048 dimensions to 128 via mel frequency scale
sample_rate = 16000
tfms = get_frequency_batch_transforms(n_fft=n_fft, n_hop=n_hop,
              n_mels=n_mels, sample_rate=sample_rate)
batch_size = 64
data = (AudioItemList.from_folder(CRYING_PATH)
     .split_by_folder()
     .label_from_folder()
     .databunch(bs=batch_size, tfms=tfms, equal_lengths=False))
learn = create_cnn(data, models.resnet34, metrics=accuracy)
learn.lr_find(start_lr=0.001, end_lr=1)
learn.recorder.plot()
```

Fastai's cyclical learning rate finder runs the model against a small batch of training samples to find a good learning rate.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*CcRfJcVFumreeKnPk0vWCw.png)

As the learning rate increases to 10e-2, you can see the model loss decrease. However, for higher learning rates, the loss begins to increase. Hence we pick 10e-2 as the learning rate for training the model.

After training the model over a few epochs, we see an accuracy of 95% over the validation set:

### Predicting over realtime audio samples

Now that we have a really good model, in order to use it in a real application, we need to be able to run predictions over an audio stream in real time.

We use the [pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/) library to read audio samples from the device microphone and then convert the audio data into numpy arrays and feed it to the model.

```python
while True:
    frames = [] # A python-list of chunks(numpy.ndarray)
    for _ in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNKSIZE * RECORD_SECONDS)):
        data = stream.read(CHUNKSIZE, exception_on_overflow=False)
        frames.append(np.fromstring(data, dtype=np.float32))
    npdata = np.hstack(frames)
    audio_clip = AudioClip.from_np(npdata, RATE)
    run_pred(audio_clip)
```

The above code reads a 7-sec audio clip from the microphone and loads that into memory. It converts it to a numpy array and runs the model on them to get a prediction. This simple piece of code is now ready to be deployed to a service or an embedded device and be used in real applications!

## Convention

The audio files should contain baby cry samples, with the corresponding tagging information encoded in the filenames. The samples were tagged by the contributors themselves. So here's how to parse the filenames.
